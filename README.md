# How to Make a ~~Perfect~~ Good Enough Repository for Reproducible Science

This is an example repository that demonstrates how to simply structure a code base and repository that comprises a scientific analysis to 
maximize reproducibility and ease-of-use for others, while minimizing the number of tools and products used to produce the result. While 
some of the components of this repository will stay constant through the use of different programming languages and/or IDEs (Integrated Development Environment), I have 
optimized this particular repo for use with the programming language R, being run through the RStudio IDE. I also assume that this repo
will be organized and edited via git. 

## A quick guide to the components of this repo

These are the main components of this repository that I think are essential to allowing for a simple, reproducbile repo that serves the needs
of you and your colleagues while you are actively working on it, and then subsequently serves the needs of other scientists after you complete your analysis and the repository is stable and mostly unchanging. You'll find more information about each of these components in the `/docs` folder in the root of this repo. Refer to those for the specific 
use of each of these components and why they're there.
