# Workflow

Using consistent practices for how to set up a repository, write code, and interface with other programs is a really useful and important component of having repositories that can be easily used by others. This set of guidelines is divided into sections and lays out how different components of the repository should be structured. 

## Making This Repo (And all your others!) Reproducible

To quote the excellent resource [Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947) by Perez-Riverol et al. (2016 - PLoS Comp Biol), "*To enable and ensure the replicability and traceability of scientific claims, it is essential that the scientific publication, the corresponding datasets, and the data analysis are made publicly available.*" The basis of doing   When thinking about making a repo reproducible, there are two different 'types' of reproducibility that are useful to consider for this particular example:

* Reproducibility for *yourself*
* Reproducibility for *others*

### Reproducibility for *yourself*

There are a number of reasons why you need a repository to be reproducible for yourself. First of all, re-running analyses is not something that necessarily happens years down the road, but often is required for whatever reason very shortly after your initial set of results are gathered. Whether a small change at the behest of a supervisor, or to appease a reviewer, having a repository that is as close to one-click reproducible will save you time and headaches galore!
