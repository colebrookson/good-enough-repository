# Workflow & Styling

Using consistent practices for how to set up a repository, write code, and interface with other programs is a really useful and important component of having repositories that can be easily used by others. This set of guidelines is divided into sections and lays out how different components of the repository should be structured. 

## Style Guide

This style guide is based largely off the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), and much of the style guidelines here are copied and pasted directly. This assumes you are using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language and likely the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE.
